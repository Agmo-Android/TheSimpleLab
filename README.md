  - To convert mills into second, you need to divide by 1000
  - Example : 20000 / 1000 = 20 Seconds
  - But in Second is for display use, in the app, is use as Mills second
- If you want to add 20 second after the event start, copy the millis + 20,000, this became your event start time.
- Pass the result to database under event > eventStartTime
